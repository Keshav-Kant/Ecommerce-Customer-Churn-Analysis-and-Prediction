# Ecommerce-Customer-Churn-Analysis-and-Prediction
Churn prediction is a crucial task for companies as it involves identifying customers who are likely to discontinue using a particular service or product. This is particularly important because acquiring new customers tends to be more expensive than retaining existing ones. By accurately predicting customer churn, companies can concentrate their efforts on retaining those customers who are most at risk of leaving, allowing them to develop effective strategies to retain them.
